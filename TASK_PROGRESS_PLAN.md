# Task Progress Feature Plan

## Overview
This feature introduces the ability to track and display task progress within the Gantt chart interface.

## Steps

1. **Add Task Progress to Store**
   - Update the tasks object in the store to include a `progress` property (e.g., percent complete) for each task.
   - Ensure the progress value is persisted and can be updated.

2. **Show Task Progress in UI**
   - Update the Gantt chart to display a progress bar inside each task bar, reflecting the current progress (e.g., % complete).
   - Ensure the progress bar is visually clear and accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each task can store and update its progress as a percentage.
- The Gantt chart visually represents progress for each task via a progress bar.
- The implementation follows Silvermine Coding Standards and user global preferences.
